    Working on EDA notebook. Fixed graph scales so they are all on the same scale and created new graph which plots the key hand and face landmarks for a particular frame as a sanity check.

    erasing old commits and updating with new commit. Changes made: 1) Working on the Action Recognition EDA. We have ensured that there are the same number of observations for each class, and have explored some key landmark location trends. Particularly, the wrist landmarks positions were analysed over the course of the different action movements to see if there were any trends we can pick up on. In addition, we looked at how the face moved throughout the movements as well. We are currently analyzing the elbow movement. 2) We motified the extraction function in the keypoints module (extract_landmarks2 fct'n) to return the body landmarks in separate groups for a data sanity check. 3) We processed the raw data using the new extraction function, and saved the body part landmarks in their own csv files. This was done in the Data Sanity Check file. We crossed referenced the x,y values from our sanity data extraction landmarks with the values we are using in our analysis. They match up - phew! I'm confident to continue on with the analysis now

    first commit. Already completed raw data collection, processing raw data using mediapipe holistic. I am currently in the process of working on exploratory data analysis (done in jupyter notebook). Data collection and processing was done in PyCharm in a modular format. I will go back and clean up every single file and add detailed notes.
